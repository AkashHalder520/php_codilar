    A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    A variable name cannot start with a number
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)
